## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-setup-web.git
cd simple-setup-web
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will launch the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or whichever port Vite assigns).

### 4. Linting and Formatting

This project includes ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting. The following scripts are available:

- **Lint the code**: This will check your code for any linting errors.
  ```bash
  yarn lint
  ```

- **Fix linting issues**: This will automatically fix the issues that ESLint can resolve.
  ```bash
  yarn lint:fix
  ```

- **Format the code**: This will format the code according to Prettier's configuration.
  ```bash
  yarn format
  ```

### 5. Build the Project

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will transpile the TypeScript code, bundle the app, and optimize it for production.

### 6. Preview the Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
yarn preview
```

This will start a local server to preview your app in its production version.

## Configuration

### TypeScript

TypeScript is set up with the following configurations:

- `tsconfig.json` - Base TypeScript configuration.
- `tsconfig.app.json` - TypeScript configuration specifically for the app.
- `tsconfig.node.json` - TypeScript configuration for Node.js.

### ESLint

This project uses ESLint to maintain code quality. The configuration is provided in `eslint.config.js` and includes the
following plugins:

- `eslint-plugin-react`: For linting React-specific code.
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`: For linting React Hooks.
- `eslint-plugin-prettier`: For integrating Prettier with ESLint.
- `eslint-config-prettier`: To disable conflicting ESLint rules with Prettier.

You can customize the ESLint rules by modifying the `eslint.config.js` file.

### Prettier

Prettier is used for consistent code formatting. The Prettier configuration can be customized in the `package.json` or
through a `.prettierrc` file if added.

## Dependencies

- **React**: The main UI library.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety for the project.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing linting errors.
- **Prettier**: A tool for automatic code formatting.
